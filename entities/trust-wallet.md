Trust Wallet is an easy to use, multi cryptocurrency wallet which can connect with and trade over decentralised exchanges (DEX Wallet support).

The crypto wallet now supports on-wallet staking, allowing users to earn rewards on supported proof of stake (POS) & delegated proof of stake (DPoS) tokens. Users who would like to avoid crypto mining or Bitcoin mining can now use Trust Wallet to earn rewards with regular app updates to support more tokenised cash/stable coins/e-money and cryptocurrencies, whilst users can buy Bitcoin/buy cryptocurrency directly from the crypto wallet with a wide range of payment options available.

Trust Browser is a full-fledged Web3 browser that allows you to interact with decentralized applications (DApp) directly from the crypto wallet app.
