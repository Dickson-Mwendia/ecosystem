ZΞD is a stable and thoroughbred manager where stable owners can buy, breed, sell and race digital thoroughbreds, live on the #blockchain. Each racehorse is uniquely created with a smart contract on the ethereum network that links performance data using cryptography.

In ZED, players can build a star-studded stable of winning racehorses and create a legacy by buying, breeding and racing digital thoroughbreds.

All racehorses in ZED are statistically unique and are defined by their bloodline, genotype and their performance on the racetrack.

The more your thoroughbred races and the more it breeds, the more superior your racehorse’s legacy becomes. The greater the legacy, the greater the wealth you can create by commanding a higher selling or breeding price through ZED’s auction system.

Buy your colt, filly, mare or stallion today and create your legacy!
